the accuracy scores are highlighted in yellow

## Difference with the Given Results

![alt text](images/Week5_S_checkpoint/difference.png)

with TFIDF: I have slighter better results than the given F1 scores for two datasets, the rest are only slighter lower than the given performance (with no more than 0.1 difference)/

with Word2Vec, I have slighter better results than the given F1 scores for three coarse datasets, yet the performance for the fine nyt dataset are a lot lower than the given performance.
